* evaluation.py:
    * Evaluate a trained model on the basis of different metrics (precision, weighted sensitivity)
* evaluate_model.py
    * contains evaluate function, which calculates prediciton quality metrics and logs the results
* make_plots.py
    * create weighted sensitivty vs precision plots from results of roc.py
* predictor_comparison.py
    * generation of plots weighted sensitivity vs precision
* pymol_generation.py
    * generate pymol files for visualizing molecules and predictions for a trained model
* roc.py
    * for a trained model, calculate the weighted sensitivity and precision for different filter levels
